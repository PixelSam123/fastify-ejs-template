# fastify-ejs-template

Minimal Fastify template using the [EJS view engine](https://github.com/mde/ejs), plus [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) and [pino-colada](https://github.com/lrlna/pino-colada) for development, partially based on Fastify CLI's generate command

---

## Initial setup

Change `name`, `author` and `license` in package.json to what you want.

## Running the server

Simply run `npm start` or `npm run dev` according to your needs.

## Registering plugins

Register the plugins you need after the three plugins (`fastify-sensible`, `fastify-static` and `point-of-view`) already listed in app.js under the comment `// Register your plugins here`  
One plugin I recommend is [fastify-helmet](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-helmet) if you want to use Fastify in production.
